[GSM LG U8120](https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_u8120-843.php), JAVA2ME, platform SonyEricsson K500

The idea then was to run the UART through J2ME to read the K line of the VAG group ECU ... and various other UART applications such as unlocking GSM with GSM :)

Unfortunately it was not a UART shared...
